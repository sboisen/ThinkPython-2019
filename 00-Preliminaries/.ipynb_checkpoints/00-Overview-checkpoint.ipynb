    "According to research presented by Daniel Pink in [When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing, by Daniel H. Pink](https://www.amazon.com/When-Scientific-Secrets-Perfect-Timing-ebook/dp/B072Q985YX?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=semanticbible-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=c5e8d9a8f16398444afcec506a6346ef&camp=1789&creative=9325), most people exhibit a peak, a trough, and a rebound in their daily energy levels (and for 75% of people, mornings are the peak). So it's important to align your most important tasks with your peaks. (Yes, I recognize the irony that I've scheduled our class for what is a trough time for most people.)\n"
