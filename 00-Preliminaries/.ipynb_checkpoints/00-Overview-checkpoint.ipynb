Similarly, at particular points in the class I'll do a pulse check to make sure everybody's with me: if you are, you'll put your blue \"all good\" note up, and if not, the orange one. \n",

So it's important to align your most important tasks with your peaks. (Yes, I recognize the irony that I've scheduled our class for what is a trough time for most people.)\n"
