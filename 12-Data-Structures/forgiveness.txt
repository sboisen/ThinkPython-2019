# The Geography of Forgiveness

### Matt 14:13–21; 15:29–39; 16:5–12

## Key Points

* The geographical significance of the two feeding miracles brings fresh understanding to Jesus' warning about the "yeast" of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
* Each miracle was performed in a different political region for two different crowds: first for the Jews in Galilee, then for the Gentiles in the Decapolis.
* With both sites in view from their boat, Jesus implicitly affirms his love and forgiveness for all people as he verbally warns them of the worldview that seeks to fence in God's mercy.

The words and actions of Jesus speak to our deepest need, the need to
know that we are forgiven. Each sinner who feels the looming shadow of
divine displeasure longs to know that this vital message of hope applies
to them, to people who live where they do. So the Bible speaks to the
geographical scope of forgiveness more than once and in more than one
way. John declares it in these familiar words: “For God so loved *the
world* that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him
shall not perish but have eternal life” (John 3:16 NIV, emphasis added).
What John clearly declared, Jesus demonstrated with two feeding miracles
performed in two different places for two different ethnic groups to
illustrate that the kingdom of God was meant for people on all shores of
the Sea of Galilee. After the second miracle, Jesus raised the topic
once again to confirm the matter in Matt 16:5–12.

## What is the "Yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees"?

But there was a problem. The disciples had missed the larger point of
the two feeding miracles and left themselves open to a dangerous way of
thinking that would bring serious harm to the kingdom of God. Jesus
addresses the magnitude of their failure with sharp and critical
language. They were not remembering. They were not thinking carefully.
And this had to stop. But before he speaks to the problem, he recasts
the problem using the image of yeast. He employs a phrase which he repeats
three times in eight verses. He urges them to be on their guard against
“the yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees” (Matt 16:6, 11, 12).

Yeast was and is an important ingredient used when making bread. And
if there is one thing we meet frequently in this and the preceding
chapters, it is bread. It is mentioned three times in the feeding of
the five thousand (Matt 14:17, 19), once in the exchange with the
Canaanite woman from the region of Tyre and Sidon (Matt 15:26), and
three times in the feeding of the four thousand (Matt 15:33, 34,
36). In each case, the NIV translates the Greek term for bread (artos)
with either “bread” or “loaf.” This same word appears no less than
seven times in Matt 16:5–12. With all this bread strewn throughout
these verses, we may fall into the same careless pattern of thinking
that plagued the disciples. They assumed that Jesus was still talking
about literal bread when they got into the boat. In fact, they assumed
Jesus’ sharp words were meant to criticize their failure to secure the
bread needed for the extended trip they were starting as they pushed
off from shore.

But the sharp language of Jesus and his repeated mention of “yeast”
addressed something much more problematic than a lack of bread in the
boat. Let’s start with the simple fact that the lack of bread was not a
problem. The disciples should have known this given the two feeding
miracles they had just witnessed. Jesus could have miraculously supplied
the bread which they had forgotten to bring. The lack of bread was
not the problem; the problem was a form of “yeast.”

This was as common a product as
you could find within the culture of Jesus’ day, but it looked much
different from the yeast we might purchase for baking. It did not come
in a small packet purchased from the local grocery store. The yeast of
Bible times was a piece of fermented bread dough which had been saved
from the previous session of bread making. When a small amount of
this yeast is mixed into the new batch of bread dough, it produces
carbon dioxide which causes the larger mass of dough to rise and
enhance the taste of the bread.

The Bible invites us to think positively about it. Yeast is an
ingredient used to prepare temple sacrifices (Lev 7:13; 23:17) and is
used by no less than Jesus to speak metaphorically about the growth of
the kingdom of God (Matt 13:33). But yeast can also carry a strong
negative connotation. It was removed from the Israelite home during
Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread (Exod 12:15, 18–20). The
negative connotation associated with yeast persists into 1 Cor 5:6–8.
Here it becomes a metaphor for how something small can have a dramatic
yet harmful effect. It is this kind of “yeast” Jesus has in mind in
these verses. He likens a notion championed by the Jewish religious
leaders to a small amount of yeast. Many had adopted the notion and
considered it a helpful way of thinking. By contrast Jesus knew it
would have a far-reaching and devastating impact on the kingdom of God
if left unchecked.

What is this teaching? Some have concluded that Jesus was warning
against adopting the Sadducees' rejection of the resurrection (Matt 22:23)
or the Pharisees' misuse of human tradition (Matt 15:2–3). A
stronger case could be made from the nearer context in which the
Pharisees and Sadducees demand a sign from Jesus (Matt 16:1–4). What is
missing from both explanations is interaction with the geography of this
story, the geography of the two feeding miracles, and the way in which
the feeding miracles are meant to defeat the errant thinking Jesus
refers to as the “yeast of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.”
